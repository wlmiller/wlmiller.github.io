I'm Neal Miller, a software engineer based in Houston, TX.  I earned a Ph.D. from [Columbia University](http://columbia.edu) studying [self-assembly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-assembly) in [soft matter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_matter) systems. In particular, I wrote, ran, and analyzed simulations of such systems; you can see a couple of examples of such simulations [on GitHub](https://github.com/wlmiller/GradSchool).

After grad school, I moved home to Houston and joined [Reasoning Mind](http://reasoningmind.org), where I had a wide range of responsibilities; among them, I did some [educational data mining](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_data_mining).  An example of a small piece of that work can be seen [here](https://github.com/wlmiller/BKTSimulatedAnnealing).  More information about my EDM work as well as my soft matter work from grad school can be found under [Publications](publications.html).

On leaving Reasoning Mind, I took a position as Lead Software Engineer at [RigMinder](http://rigminder.com).  As the leader of RigMinder's software engineering team, I help determine the direction of software development to best meet client needs and position the company for future growth.  I keep a full view of the company's business in order to determine the best allocation of our development resources.

In addition to management, I also write code every day, contributing to the full stack of RigMinder's software offerings - client software, server software, embedded firmware, database and server administration, web applications, and anything else that's needed.  This means that I tackle any of a vast array of interesting challenges using technologies from a very broad toolset.
