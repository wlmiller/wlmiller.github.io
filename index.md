I'm Neal Miller, a software engineer based in Houston, TX.  I earned a Ph.D. from [Columbia University](http://columbia.edu) studying [self-assembly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-assembly) in [soft matter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_matter) systems. In particular, I wrote, ran, and analyzed simulations of such systems; you can see a couple of examples of such simulations [on GitHub](https://github.com/wlmiller/GradSchool).

After grad school, I moved home to Houston and worked with [Reasoning Mind](https://reasoningmind.org) and [RigMinder](http://rigminder.com) before joining [Durwella](http://durwella.com).
Durwella is a software solutions company that focuses on scientific and engineering projects; I use my technical expertise and scientific background to develop a variety of applications.
My primary focus is cross-platform mobile applications using frameworks such as [Xamarin](https://www.xamarin.com/) and [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/), but I'm not limited to such projects -- for example, recent work has involved extensions for the [Petrel](https://www.software.slb.com/products/petrel) and [SKUA-GOCAD](http://www.pdgm.com/products/skua-gocad/) geoscience platforms, with other wide-ranging projects planned.
