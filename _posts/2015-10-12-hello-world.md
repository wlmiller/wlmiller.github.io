This is my attempt to get into blogging regularly.
As I describe on my [About Me](/about.html) page, I'm a physics Ph.D. who did a stint working as a data scientist in ed tech before becoming a full-time software developer -- I'd like to think that means I have some interesting things to say.

I plan to post about a wide variety of things, from my grad school work to whatever I happen to be working on at the moment.
Here at RigMinder, that's going to be some combination of Python, Go, C#, JavaScript, and a smattering of other things -- for side projects, who knows?
I also love learning new languages, and hope I'll have something interesting to post about languages like Rust or F# as I have the time to dig into them.
